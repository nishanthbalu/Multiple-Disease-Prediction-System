Multiple Disease Prediction System
Machine Learning Project

Project Objectives:
The objective of this project is to use the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to create a model that can predict 
  whether a patient has diabetes or heart disease. The model will be trained and tested using the diabetic and
  heart disease datasets from Kaggle..

Requirements:
• Python 3.x
• Kaggle API/Dataset
• Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:
• Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
• NumPy: for numerical computing
• Scikit-learn: for machine learning models and evaluation
• Pickle: for saving the model
• Streamlit: for building the web app

Data:
• The diabetic dataset from Kaggle contains information about patients with diabetes, including their age, blood pressure,
  and other health parameters. The heart disease dataset from Kaggle contains information about patients with
  heart disease, including their age, blood pressure, and other health parameters.

Procedure:
• Import the necessary libraries and the diabetic and heart disease datasets.
• Split the data into features and target variables.
• Split the data into training and testing sets.
• Create a KNN model with k=5.
• Train the model on the training data.
• Save the model using the pickle module.
• Use Streamlit to create a web application that allows users to input their own data
  and make predictions using the saved model.
• Include a submit button in the application to process the user input and make predictions.

Deployment:
• Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt
• Use streamlit main.py to run the web application
• Interact with the application in the browser window that opens up.
• The model will be loaded from the pickle file and be ready for use.

Conclusion:
• This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model using the KNN algorithm, save it using the pickle 
	module, and deploy it as a web application using Streamlit. The model can be used for predicting whether a patient
	has diabetes or heart disease based on their age, blood pressure, and other health parameters
